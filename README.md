# ScotBot
Requested by Scotti to poll reactions

Simmple and hardcoded for now I guess.

## Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the same folder as scotbot.py
2. Add `SCOT_TOKEN=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN` and save
3. Run scotbot.py when ready

How this works:
1. React with 🏁 (:checkered_flag:) on a message to receive a DM from ScotBot with a list of users who have reacted to the same message with 🇾(:regional_indicator_y:)

That's it, you're done. :)

#### Notes
All this does is look at reactions at the moment. No need to give it admin privileges. Read message history should be fine.
